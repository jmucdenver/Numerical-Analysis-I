    "In the previous section, we discussed representing real numbers in a computer. Here we will give a brief discussion of representing integers. How does a computer represent an integer $n$? As in real numbers, we start with writing $n$ in base 2. We have 64 bits to represent its digits and sign. As in the floating-point representation, we can allocate one bit for the sign, and use the rest, 63 bits, for the digits. This approach has some disadvantages when we start adding integers. Another approach, known as the **two's complement**, is more commonly used, including in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example, assume we have 8 bits in our computer. To represent 12 in two's complement (or any positive integer), we simply write it in its base 2 expansion: $(00001100)_2$. To represent $-12$, we do the following: flip all digits, replacing 1 by 0, and 0 by 1, and then add 1 to the result. When we flip digits for 12, we get  $(11110011)_2$, and adding 1 (in binary), gives $(11110100)_2$. Therefore $-12$ is represented as $(11110100)_2$ in two's complement approach. It may seem mysterious to go through all this trouble to represent $-12$, until you add the representations of 12 and $-12$,\n",

Any integer below or above yields **underflow** or **overflow** error. However, Python is special compared to the other programming languages in that it supports arbitrary-precision integer implementation. Integers of any size can be supported in Python, while it is not true for floats."
